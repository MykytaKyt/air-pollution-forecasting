### Prerequisites

List any software, libraries, or hardware that users need to have installed or set up before they can use your project.

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions for installing any necessary software or libraries. Include code snippets or commands where applicable.

## Training the Model

Explain how to train the machine learning model using the `train.py` script. Provide any relevant details about data preprocessing, model architecture, and training options.

```bash
make train
```

## Evaluating the Model

Explain how to evaluate the trained model using the `eval.py` script. Describe the metrics used for evaluation and how to interpret the results.

```bash
make eval
```

## Running the Gradio Demo

```

## Usage Examples

Provide usage examples and code snippets to demonstrate how users can interact with your project, make predictions, or integrate it into their own applications.

```python
# Example code to use the trained model
import gradio as gr

# Create an interface for making predictions
iface = gr.Interface.load("gradio_demo.py")

# Input sample data and get predictions
result = iface.process([sample_data])

# Display the prediction result
print(result)
```
